There seems to be a bug with ATI's Crimson drivers causing fans to not go over 20% usage, potentially leading to overheating and damaging the card itself. Reddit link (https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3upbnm/beware_when_updating_to_the_amd_crimson_drivers/) ATI has acknowledged the issue ( Twitter link (https://twitter.com/AMDRadeon/status/671058196547706880)) and says they will be issuing a fix tomorrow.

OK. I'm not a hundred percent sure about the cause - but everything so far seems to point to the driver - so I thought I'd post a warning while I do further tests. In the last couple of weeks I've done two things - started playing with a bunch of mods enabled AND downloaded the ATI Crimson 16.7 driver when I got an update notice.

It was a fairly frustrating initial experience, with around 2+hrs spent on the github docs, this subreddit, and just playing with the osvr server and monitor configurations.

As the title says I just a couple days ago purchased all the parts I needed to build my new gaming PC from Micro Center. The previous computer(pentium g3258 and a gtx 760) was shared by me and my gf so she took over that PC which for wow runs between 60-85 frames at all times. Now I am having issues with the new computer, that I assumed was going to be an upgrade, with consistency of frame rate and overall lower frames.

I have two ATI Radeon HD6870s in a Crossfire setup. I can only play the game if I disable Crossfire and run only 1 card. One HD6870 allows me to run the game at 'High' graphics settings at 60fps. Anything higher and the game sputters in intense battles. Enabling Crossfire results in intense screen flashes. Has anyone figured out a way to get Crossfire to work?

This odd bug has been bothering me for months. Just now, I found this 8 month old post (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/3ybkna/is_it_normal_my_gpu_usage_jumps_from_0_to_100/cyc40pk) from this very subreddit thanks to a convoluted google search and was thrilled that something finally worked, and thought others might not have seen it.

Hey, had to format my main drive and decided to give this a go instead of CCC. HOW-IT-USED-TO-BE: Back in CCC I could manage multiple displays by simply right-clicking the traybar icon and selecting the respective video-output and either extending, cloning or whatever I wanted for my secondary display. HOW-IT-IS-NOW: There are ZERO options to manage multi displays, I don't think this even has an advanced mode anymore (I can't find it, even under the "Extra configurations" there's nothi. \ FOR REDDIT MODS: This post is a beacon for returning AMD players. It informs AMD users that currently CANNOT PLAY gwont about the possible way of return to the game, if they wish to. Also, it leads to the official CDPR FORUM where the actual technical discussion takes place, so it doesn't violate the reddit rules.\ As many of AMD/ATI Radeon people know, CDPR broke the game for at least AMD Legacy Driver Packs users in late Jan., so Gwent was unplayable on AMD/ATI Radeon since. I own an HP Elitebook 8460p with built-in AMD graphics. The graphics installed is an AMD HD 7400M, but whenever I launch Radeon Setting, it always says that there's an update available. I update my GPU but it still says for an update. I use AMD Crimson of the version number 16.2.1 in the system tab but when I go to my notifications, it says that my version number is 15.301.1902160226a-318062E and the new software update is 16.60.2011-10210a-311199C-ATI

Hi Guys, So Microsoft have done it again. I have tried my heart out to ensure windows update does not update the whole. Epic fail. The other day, I get home to see the almighty update busy installing, after it restarted, my 6 card rig using claymore was only giving me 31M/H. Luckily I had some help from a mate who knows what to do. He redirected me to AMD's site and I downloaded the NEW blockchain drivers. https://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/Radeon-Software-Crimson-ReLive-E. Hi there! Does anybody know of an up-to-date piece of software that allows manually setting 2d clock speeds on the gpu? AMD's Adrenaline overclocking plummets the 2d clock speeds on my 7950 from 500/900 to 300/150, which instantly causes graphical artifacts if a second monitor is plugged in. This has been well-documented since at least 2012 and has only been fixed in a couple older versions of OverDrive/Crimson that were broken again in subsequent updates. I've also had no success in revertin. Hello guys, I’ve been having issues trying to install a XFX ATI HD 6850 on my friend’s Windows 10 PC. I plug it into to the PCIE slot, connect the one PCIE cable, and proceed to install the AMD drivers. Here’s where the problems begin. First, I used DDU to uninstall the previous drivers, as he had a GTX 460 before. I went through the process, and then went to the AMD website. I find the driver download page for the 6850. Now, there are 2 options, one for this Crimson installer
